Cristina and the staff were very friendly and caring during my Grandmother's stay there. Cristina went out of her way to help me figure out what programs my grandmother qualifies for and made it so much easier to navigate those waters. She met with me, my mother and my aunt and was always open to communication and patient with us during the process. They also did their best to make my grandmother feel welcome and cared for. Very grateful for their effort during a very tough time.NDO
