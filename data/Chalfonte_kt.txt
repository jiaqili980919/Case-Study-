DO NOT MOVE HERE! This is why.... 1. This place is infested with BED BUGS. The manager, Steve will lie and say that there it is not a current problem but that's not the case. It's only a matter of time before it becomes an issue. My unit had to be fumigated and Steve said my neighbors next door were filthy and that's where the problem started. I spoke to my neighbors and they said the unit above them was infested and Steve said the problem came from them. In other words, management knows the building is invested and will just blame it on someone else. I saw a couple roaches here & there but that doesn't compare to being eaten alive by nasty bed bugs. They are a huge headache to her rid of too. 2. The manager will enter your apartment without permission to fix repairs. How do I know? I filled out a maintenance sheet and checked 'Do not enter unless resident is present'. A friend was using the restroom when Steve& maintenance opened the apartment door anyway to fix the repair. 3. Don't expect to get your full security deposit back. They will make up some bs as to why all of your money can't be returned. 4. The walls a extra thin & the elevator never works. I'm glad I only had a sixth month contract at this place & I left as soon as possible. Save yourself the headache and find somewhere else to live.
