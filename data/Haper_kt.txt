Brand new "luxury" apartment in k-town with so much potential... yet already a lot of concerns. This apartment opened its doors too early. Writing this review in hopes that the property management team can make some changes before more residents start living here. 
- Two scheduled LADWP electrical outages for pretty much the entire day in a span of a month. I' ve lived in two brand new apartments prior to this. I never experienced this problem before - did they not get their proper inspections done beforehand? If you work from home, this will become your biggest concern. 
- Currently writing this in an unexpected power outage the day before the scheduled power outage so now I have to deal with spoiled food along with not being able to finish my work. 
- Overall property maintenance/cleaning needs to be improved. For a brand new apartment, it is shocking to see how dirty some of the common areas are becoming. How can they even tour this place to new prospective tenants? I wouldn't sign the lease if I see the property in its state currently.   Trash cans outside the gym has been full since I' ve moved in. The rooftop already has signs of neglect despite the outdoor cushions still unwrapped not put together. Lack of landscape maintenance is causing weeds to thrive. Dead plants are more common with cigarette butts. The grill is already filthy. No signs of mopping or general cleaning - the rooftop, once gorgeous, is becoming filled with tenants who don't pick up after their dog. The courtyard is a breeding ground for flies and the ground has never been cleaned. 
- No front door security. The security sits in front of the garage instead of the front door. We need one in the front. It's just an empty desk - only a matter of time before unwanted guests can wander through the hallways and packages go missing. 
- The management likes to nickel and dime you for everything. $125 monthly parking- no concession. Oh wait, add a deposit & another parking fee. $20 for package concierge system.
- all these charges but the moment you try to have a guest park, they will threaten you with 3 towing emails. This place has so many empty spots, why not allow some spaces to be opened up? 
- 1st floor parking will have tons of pigeons and bird crap. 
- garage is already leaking in some places.  
- trash and recycle receptacles are overflowing. 

We're not even near a full vacancy... can't imagine how the management will keep up with the building at even 50%. 

I pay way too much for my place to not have a clean property. I really hope that the management company can start taking care of minor problems before they become bigger.
