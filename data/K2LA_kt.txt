Beautiful, modern new building with a killer rooftop, great amenities and a very friendly and helpful staff. Megan in the leasing office is the kindest, most helpful person! She took care of all of my requests, so grateful for her! The security, Steve and Tony were also super helpful and a pleasure to chat with when passing thru the lobby. Greg, in maintenance was also super helpful and quick to respond to requests. The building is winning but the location killed it for me. The construction and homeless was intense so be sure to consider this.
