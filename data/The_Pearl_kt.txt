Scarlett was my leasing agent and the tour was so exceptional that I applied that same day! Before moving to LA I toured 12 apartment buildings all over the city, and I can honestly say that The Pearl offered the best overall experience. Scarlett was very helpful with informing me about the building, the surrounding area, and the future developments that would take place in the apartment. She took the time to process everything and respond very quickly, and made my move-in very painless. Even after I moved in I can tell that she is very friendly and accommodating to all the residents, and I'm thankful that I met such a good person to help me start my new life in LA! Overall the entire staff at The Pearl is very friendly and helpful, and the amenities in this building are excellent. What I like most is that the building is under constant improvement and adding new amenities. The staff also listens closely to the resident\'92s comments, and makes improvements according to our concerns. It feels like the staff really cares about the people who live here, which is not something I have experienced in other apartments I have lived in! I love this place and would definitely recommend living here to anyone else!
