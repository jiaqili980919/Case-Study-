I' ve lived in good old glorious KTown for about 3 years now. No matter how hard I try to leave this hell hole of a city it seems to shackle me here. Sure the food is good and there are things to do, but I don't even want to go outside. It's hard to stay inside because of all the helicopters and police sirens that blare on a nightly basis. My lease was up, and I thought about moving back to Orange County or any other county. Then one day on the way to work I drive past Aria hotel. I thought to myself what is this baller ass building? I did some research and fell in love. I made an appointment and William showed me around. I couldn't believe what I was walking through. A dog park on the roof? A one acre walking area that's dog friendly? Korean bbq tables all along the roof? A gym that rivals 24 hour fitness? A heated pool? Floor to ceiling windows with crazy views? A WASHER AND DRYER INSIDE THE FREAKIN APARTMENT??? There's no way I could afford this place. Only doctors lawyers and nba players can live here. Then William proceeded to tell me that I was wrong and gave me pricing. The rest is history. Not only is this place drop dead gorgeous. But the amenities are ridiculous. Parking is awesome. The concierge is super helpful. Yes I said concierge. They have a concierge here that does everything. Cleaning people are cleaning something every 5 seconds. Security looks like they can actually take down some intruders. And the property managers are incredibly informative and friendly. Yes I still live in stupid ktown but ktown looks so much beautiful looking out from floor to ceiling windows. Also I don't have to worry about my dog getting jacked when I take her for a walk at night. If you are unfortunate enough to live in this hell hole of a city, there is a heaven at Kurve.
